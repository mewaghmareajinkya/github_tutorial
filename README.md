Theory and Workflow (No Code)
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

Dataset: The process begins by acquiring a credit card fraud detection dataset, which contains various transaction features and a binary label indicating fraud or not.

Feature Selection: The 'Time' column is dropped (as it may not be informative for modeling), and the 'Class' column is separated as the target variable.

Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, ensuring that the proportion of fraud and non-fraud cases is maintained in both sets (stratification).

Scaling: All feature values are standardized so they have zero mean and unit variance. This helps neural networks train more effectively and ensures fair comparison among optimizers.

2. Neural Network Model Architecture

A feedforward neural network (multi-layer perceptron) is used, consisting of several fully connected layers.

Hidden layers use the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function to introduce non-linearity, allowing the model to learn complex patterns.

The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function, suitable for binary classification tasks (fraud vs. not fraud).

3. Optimizer Comparison

The central goal is to compare how different optimization algorithms affect neural network training.

Optimizers Compared:

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Basic optimizer that updates weights using gradients calculated from mini-batches.

SGD with Momentum: Enhances SGD by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update, helping to accelerate convergence and avoid local minima.

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG): A variant of momentum that anticipates future gradients, often leading to faster convergence.

Adagrad: Adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on past gradients, performing well for sparse data.

RMSprop: Maintains a moving average of squared gradients to normalize the learning rate, addressing Adagrad's rapid learning rate decay.

Adam: Combines momentum and RMSprop techniques, adapting learning rates and smoothing updates for robust performance.

4. Training and Validation

For each optimizer, a new instance of the neural network is trained on the training data.

During training, a portion of the training set is held out for validation to monitor learning progress and prevent overfitting.

Key metrics tracked are loss (how well the model fits the data) and accuracy (percentage of correct predictions).

5. Visualization and Analysis

After training, the loss and accuracy curves for both training and validation sets are plotted for each optimizer pair.

These plots provide visual insight into:

How quickly each optimizer reduces the loss.

Whether the optimizer leads to better generalization (higher validation accuracy).

The stability of training (smoothness of curves, presence of overfitting or underfitting).

6. Workflow Summary

Load and preprocess the data.

Define a consistent neural network architecture.

For each pair of optimizers, train the model separately and record the training history.

Visualize and compare the performance across optimizers using loss and accuracy plots.

Draw conclusions about which optimizer is most effective for this specific dataset and model architecture.

This workflow enables a systematic and fair comparison of optimization algorithms in deep learning, highlighting their practical differences in convergence speed, stability, and final model performance.# github_tutorial
